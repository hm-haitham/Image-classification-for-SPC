# CS433 Project 2 : ML_HAR

We had to work on a project with Swiss Plasma Center as part of the Machine Learning course CS-433 at EPFL.

## Result:

   - **95.43%** Accuracy of classification.


## Files: 

- `Report`: Contains the report in PDF.
- `Python scripts`:
    - 'data_creation.py': contains the code and libraries used for data generation and extraction. For Confidentiality reasons, the access to the server is secured by SSH key authentication and is open only to individuals working on Mantis data and TCV tokamak won't. 
    - 'Diagnostic.py' and 'MANTIS.py': Auxiliairy material given by our project supervisor.
    - 'model_training.py': contains the final CNN model we kept for Image Recognition. You can run the file on inputs of your choice in order to test also train the model.
   
- `Notebooks`: 
   - 'model_training.ipynb' : Since it is not possible to run the corresponding python script, we showed the results through this notebook.
   - 'transfer_learning.ipynb' : Contains the methods applied for transfer learning and the results.
   
   - `CNN model`: 'trained_model.h5' 

- `Data`: We will not be able to deliver the dataset along with the submission. It has size of 200Mb. We could evetually share It with you by means of Drive or WeTransfer if you want so.
- 'meta.csv' : given from our supervisor that contains shot ids.
