We had to work on a project with Swiss Plasma Center as part of the Machine Learning course CS-433 at EPFL.

## Result:

   - **95.43%** Accuracy of classification.


## Files: 

- **`Report`**: Contains the report in PDF.
- `Python scripts`:
    - 'data_creation.py': contains the code and libraries used for data generation and extraction. 
    - 'Diagnostic.py' and 'MANTIS.py': Auxiliairy material given by our project supervisor.
    - 'model_training.py': contains the final CNN model we kept for Image Recognition. You can run the file on inputs of your choice in order to test also train the model.
   
- `Notebooks`: 
   - 'model_training.ipynb' : Since it is not possible to run the corresponding python script, we showed the results through this notebook.
   - 'transfer_learning.ipynb' : Contains the methods applied for transfer learning and the results.
